New ilm working about the same as old for 128x128 data. Not great
locating, but could be the image as well. I should try a different
area.

256x256 not very clean right now. Maybe just not optimized currently,
but may need to change parameters.

Ideas:
I'm thinking for the next couple days I might want to get 128x128x50
working ok and get a few subsequent images processed that I can analyze
while I work on finding the best peri parameters for using on larger
images.

I could also just run that analysis on the old images from the previous
data set that I have working ok already? But I do want the larger field
of view. Not sure what I can acomplish by Friday. Should go in tomorrow
and make sure I talk to Meera.

Code currently running:
1) Optimize 128x128x50 new ilm further. Attempting to get one good one
working

1.5) Translated featuring to u1 in 128x128x50 new ilm. Looks pretty good
except for a couple of obviously misfeatured particles.

2) TO DO: Center image 128x128x50-- Try different part of image to see 
if there is just one segment not working.

3) 512x512x50 -- Working on polishing initial optimization for a full
siz image. Not very confident on this working though.
	--it looks kind of rough after first making. Would need a fair bit
more polishing.

4) TO DO: 128x128x100 -- Get larger image up so I can run larger analysis.

5) 64x64x100 first to get psf right? Probably good.
	-- did some orthomanipulating to work on fixing misfeatured parts.
