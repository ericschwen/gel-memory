# GEL MEMORY

This repository contains the code associated with the paper "Embedding orthogonal memories in a colloidal gel through oscillatory shear" by Eric M. Schwen, Meera Ramaswamy, Chieh-Min Cheng, Linda Jan, and Itai Cohen. The published version of the paper is available from Soft Matter [https://doi.org/10.1039/C9SM02222H](https://doi.org/10.1039/C9SM02222H). A preprint is freely avaiable at [https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12991](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12991).

The contents of this repository include: importing .lsm microscope images, filtering the processed images, tracking particles using Trackpy (found here -- [http://soft-matter.github.io/trackpy/v0.6.1/](http://soft-matter.github.io/trackpy/v0.6.1/)) and Parameter Extraction from Reconstruction of Images (PERI -- found here [https://github.com/peri-source/peri/tree/master](https://github.com/peri-source/peri/tree/master)), analysis of particle positions and configurations over time, and visualization of the results.
